## Directory structure and workflow
[Manuscript] (https://github.com/NMRLipids/lipid_ionINTERACTION/tree/master/Manuscript)  -- contains the current version of the manuscript in raw LaTex format and in pdf.

[Data] (https://github.com/NMRLipids/lipid_ionINTERACTION/tree/master/Data) -- contains the data used in the manuscript

[Figs] (https://github.com/NMRLipids/lipid_ionINTERACTION/tree/master/Fig) -- contains the figures and scripts to generate those from the Data folder.

[Scratch] (https://github.com/NMRLipids/lipid_ionINTERACTION/tree/master/scratch) -- contains everything else and all the work in progress which is not ready for the Data folder.

The up-to-date manuscript of each project will be always found from the Manuscript folder. The manuscript also contains a ToDo list with specific issues to be improved (unless it is finished). The discussion will be done at GitHub issue tracker and at [nmrlipids.blogspot.fi](nmrlipids.blogspot.fi).

The [NMRlipids authorship guidelines](http://nmrlipids.blogspot.fi/2013/07/on-credits.html) apply to this repository.
