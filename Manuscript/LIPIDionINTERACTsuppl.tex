\section{Ion binding equilibration times}
Simulations containing 450~mM CaCl$_2$ with CHARMM36 and Slipids were ran 2~$\mu$s to estimate the times
required to equilibrate amount of bound Ca$^{2+}$ in lipid bilayer. The amount of bound calcium
as a function of simulation time from these simulations are shown in Fig.~\ref{longruns}.
The results show a clear increase in ion binding up to 1000~ns and 700~ns in CHARMM36 and Slipids, respectively,
and moderate increase even after this. This is also reflected to the CHARMM36 results in Fig.~2 in the main text, where
long CHARMM36 simulation with 450~mM CaCl$_2$ show relatively lower order parameters than shorter simulations. 
This can be rationalised with higher and more equilibrated ion binding in long simulations. 
The results suggest that in other simulations the binding affinity 
may be underestimated due to the insufficient equilibration times. This should be taken into account in more careful studies,
but do not interfere the conclusion in this work that Ca$^{2+}$ binding is most likely overestimated in all the
other models than CHARMM36 with ion model by Yoo et al. \cite{yoo16}.

\section{Change of choline order parameters as a function of bound cation charge}


To demonstrate that also in current MD simulations the molecular electrometer works as Seelig and coworkers proposed in the 1980's (that is, there is a direct relationship between the changes in the choline $\beta$ and $\alpha$ segment order parameters and the amount of penetrated charge), we calculated the bound cation charge and the corresponding order parameter change separately for each leaflet in several MD simulation systems.

As in reality ions have continuum density distributions, any division to bound and non-bound ions is somewhat artificial,
and thus the choice of parameters describing ion partitioning is more or less ambiguous.
We chose to integrate the cation charge distribution from the centre of the membrane until a certain predefined limit. Three limits were tested:
until the g$_3$-carbon (Fig.~\ref{electrometer_g3}), until the phosphorus (Fig.~3 in the main text), and until the $\alpha$-carbon (Fig.~\ref{electrometer_ca}) density maximum. Although phosphorus seems to be the most intuitive choice, comparison of these three plots shows that the conclusions we draw here do not depend on the chosen limit.
That said, we must stress that the slopes of the curves depend {\bf strongly} on the chosen limit; therefore, one should be very careful when comparing them to one another or to experimental data --- a given limit might or might not match with what is considered 'bound' in an experiment.
%To put it in other words, we can affect the slopes of the simulation curves by our choice of the integration limit, whereas the experimental slope will not be affected. This has a potential of us introducing an unconscious bias on the one hand, and on the other hand people looking at the plot might conclude one FF to be better matching the experiments than some other, although this might not be the case (both because the OPs at zero bound charge in the simulations are not correct and because of this additional effect on the slope coming from the choice of the integration limit.)

    }
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{electrometer_g3},~\ref{electrometer_ca} and~3 in the main text show that in all MD models a clear correlation exists between the bound cation charge and the change of the ($\beta$, $\alpha$) order parameters. Also, this correlation does not seem to depend heavily on ion type, as Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ fall effectively on the same line in each force field.
In other words, the plots demonstrate that the molecular electrometer is robust, that is, qualitatively reproduced also in MD simulations, and even with rather inaccurate force fields. (A similar robust effect was the reorientation of the headgroup upon dehydration in our previous paper~\cite{botan15}.)

We wish to note that with the mono- and divalent ions the bound charge is localised differently in the membrane.
Interestingly, however, it seems that a single linear slope can capture responses to both.
This is somewhat surprising, as one might expect correlation effects between the bound ions;
probably these become evident only at higher concentrations.

%We also note that the differences between force fields for order parameter changes as a function of bound charge do not seem to exactly match the differences between force fields for order parameter changes as a function of ion concentration (Fig.~\ref{ordPions}): The order parameter change as a function of bound charge is similar e.g. for Lipid14 and Berger even though significant difference is observed as a function of ion concentration, and Orange has the smallest dependence on ion concentration but strongest dependence on bound cation charge. Conclusion seems to be that in most cases the order parameter changes as a function of ion concentration arise from differences in ion binding affinity, not from different headgroup responses to ion binding. HOWEVER. The slopes are affected by the choice of the integration limit (see Figs.~\ref{electrometer_g3},~\ref{electrometer}, and \ref{electrometer_ca}), so one should be very careful with conclusions.
%The exception may be the alpha carbon for CHARMM. It has the weakest dependence on bound charge and it is the only segment which agrees with experiments as a function of Calcium concentration. It may be that CHARMM is more realisitic in this aspect --- or this might coincidental.




\section{Headgroup response to charged amphiphiles}

The order parameter changes as a function of the bound charge cannot be straightforwardly
compared between simulations and experiments from systems with ions because the 
results depend on the definition of bound ions in simulations (see previous section). In systems with charged
amphiphiles the situation is more straightforward since all the charges can be assumed 
to locate in the bilayer in both, simulations and experiments. The order parameter changes as a 
function of charged amphiphiles, calculated from previously published simulation 
data~\cite{miettinen09,DMPC_DMTAP0mol,DMPC_DMTAP6mol,DMPC_DMTAP50mol} and
experiments~\cite{scherer89,franzin98}, is shown in Fig~\ref{DMPC_DMTAP}.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{../Fig/OrderParameterDMPC_DMTAP.eps} 
  \caption{\label{DMPC_DMTAP}
    Order parameter changes as a function of cationic amphiphiles from simulations~\cite{miettinen09,DMPC_DMTAP0mol,DMPC_DMTAP6mol,DMPC_DMTAP50mol} 
    and experiments~\cite{scherer89,franzin98}. Experimental points for binary mixtures of POPC and 1,2-dioleoyloxy-3-(trimethylammonio)propane (DOTAP)
    are from ~\cite{franzin98}. Experimental lines are from $\Delta S_{\rm{CH}}^{i}=\frac{4}{3}\chi^{-1}m_i X^\pm$, where $m_i$ are taken as average
    for different amphiphiles measured in Ref.~\citenum{scherer89}.
}
\end{figure}

The simulation data is from previously published binary mixture of cationic dimyristoyltrimethylammoniumpropane (DMTAP) 
and zwitterionic (neutral) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC)~\cite{miettinen09,DMPC_DMTAP0mol,DMPC_DMTAP6mol,DMPC_DMTAP50mol},
simulated with Berger based model. The experimental data from various amphiphiles with saturated acyl chains~\cite{scherer89} show
steeper slope than the data from from DMPC/DOTAP mixtures~\cite{franzin98}. The origin of the difference is not known. 
It may arise, e.g., from the differences in acyl chain saturation level or headgroups of the amphiphiles.
In the used simulation data the amphiphile acyl chains are fully saturated as in experimental data for various 
amphiphiles from Ref.~\citenum{scherer89}, but the amphiphile headgroup and lipids are the same as in experimental data 
from Ref.~\citenum{franzin98}. The order parameter changes from simulations overestimate the changes measured in latter experiment
(especially with larger amphiphile concentrations), but are in good agreement with the former. However, the simulated
system is not exactly the same as in experiments and also, the potential effect of Cl$^-$ binding affinity cannot be excluded.
Thus, with the available data we cannot accurately determine how realistic the headgroup response to bound charge is in simulation. 

To estimate the maximum error we take the maximum amount of bound charge from Fig.~3 in the main text ($\approx$ 0.5$\frac{\rm e}{\rm nm^2}$)
and assume the area per lipid of 0.68~nm$^2$. This gives for maximum amount of bound 
charge per lipid $X^+_{\rm max}=0.5\frac{\rm e}{\rm nm^2}\cdot 0.68\frac{\rm nm^2}{\rm lipid}=0.34\frac{\rm e}{\rm lipid}$,
which is shown as dashed line in Fig.~\ref{DMPC_DMTAP}. The maximum
overestimations of order parameter decrease with this amount of bound charge per lipid are $\approx$0.04 and $\approx$0.06 for $\beta$ and $\alpha$ order parameter changes, respectively.
The numbers are smaller with less amount of bound cations. In principle,
these values could explain the overestimated order parameter change due to the presence of CaCl$_2$ in Berger model but not in the presence
of NaCl (see Fig.~2 in the main text).

In conclusion, with the current data we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the overestimated order parameter response to the
CaCl$_2$ with Berger model arises from oversensitive headgroup response to bound cations. However, in the presence of NaCl
the differences between responses in simulations and experiments in Fig.~2 in the main text are larger than the maximum estimated 
influence from a possible oversensitivity of the headgroup. 

\section{Density distributions with different CaCl$_2$ concentrations}

The density distributions with all simulated CaCl$_2$ concentrations are shown in Fig.~\ref{CAdensities}.

\section{Effect of ion model and polarization}

  \caption{\label{OPchangesSCALED}
    The effect of charge scaling~\cite{leontyev11,kohagen14} and NBFIX~\cite{venable13} on order parameter changes in simulations. 
    }
\end{figure*}

It has been suggested that the missing electronic polarizability 
can be compensated by scaling the ion charge in simulations~\cite{leontyev11}. 
To test if this would improve the Na$^+$ ion binding behaviour, we ran simulations with Berger-DPPC-97, BergerOPLS-DPPC-06
and Slipids with scaled Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions. For Berger-DPPC-97 and BergerOPLS-DPPC-06 models 
the ion charge in systems listed in Table~1 in the main text was simply scaled with 0.7 and
the related files are available 
at ~\cite{DPPCBergerNaCl150mMscaled,DPPCBergerNaCl1000mMscaled,DPPCBergerOPLS06NaCl150mMscaled,DPPCBergerOPLS06NaCl1000mMscaled}). 
For simulations with Slipids the ion model by Kohagen et al. was used~\cite{kohagen16} and the related files are 
available at~\cite{slipidsFILESpopcSCALED}. The simulation parameters were identical to those employed in the simulation of POPC with 130~mM NaCl (see Methods).
The order parameter changes and Na$^+$-binding affinity are decreased by the charge scaling but 
yet overestimated with respect to the experiments as seen from Figs. \ref{OPchangesSCALED} and~\ref{NAdensitySCALED}. 
Thus the overestimated binding affinity cannot be fixed by only scaling the charges of ions.





The ion model for CaCl$_2$ with scaled charges~\cite{kohagen14} was tested with CHARMM36 and Slipids models.
The related files are available at Refs.~\citenum{charmmFILESpopc450mMcaclSCALED} and~\citenum{slipidsFILESpopc450mMcaclSCALED},
respectively, and the results are shown in Figs.~\ref{CAdensities} and~\ref{OPchangesSCALED}.
The results with scaled charges are slightly improved but yet far from experiments.

Also the effect of NBFIX~\cite{venable13} on Na$^+$ binding in CHARMM36 is quantified.
The simulation data without NBFIX is available at~\cite{charmmPOPC350mMNaClnoNBFIXfiles}.
As expected, Figs.~\ref{OPchangesSCALED} and ~\ref{NAdensitySCALED} show 
more significant order parameter decrease and higher Na$^+$ binding affinity
without NBFIX. Thus, also the CHARMM36 model without NBFIX overestimates the
Na$^+$ binding in PC bilayer.

%I commented this out since the evidence on relation between order parameter change arising from cation binding
%is already quite strong in the manuscript.
%Because the difference promoted by NBFIX~\cite{venable13} is mainly a reduced Na$^+$ density in the headgroup region of the phospholipids,
%this behaviour suggests that it is the direct interaction between the lipids and the Na$^+$ cation 
%(and to no or much lesser extent Cl$^-$ anions) that drives the changes of the order parameters.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Simulated systems}
All simulations are ran with a standard setup for planar lipid bilayer in zero tension
with periodic boundary conditions with Gromacs (version numbers 4.5-X-5.0.X)~\cite{pronk13,abraham15} 
or NAMD~\cite{NAMD} software packages.

\subsection{Analysis}
The order parameters were calculated from simulation trajectories directly applying the equation
$S_{{\rm CH}}=\langle \frac{3}{2}  \cos^2 \theta-\frac{1}{2} \rangle$,
where $\theta$ is the angle between a given C--H bond and the bilayer normal, and the average is taken
over all lipids and time frames. For united atom models, the positions of hydrogen atoms
were calculated for each molecule in each frame \textit{a posteriori} by using the {\it g\_protonate} tool in 
Gromacs 4.0.2 \cite{gromacsMANUAL402}. 
The statistical error in the order parameter was estimated by calculating the average value separately for each lipid molecule,
and then the average and standard error of the mean over the ensemble of lipids (as done also in previous work \cite{botan15}).
All the scripts used for analysis and the resulting data are available in the GitHub repository \cite{githubIONpaper}

\subsection{Simulation details}

\subsubsection{Berger}
{\it POPC:} The simulation without ions is the same as in Ref.~\citenum{ferreira13} and the files are available at Ref.~\citenum{bergerFILESpopc}. 
The starting structures for simulations with ions is made by replacing water molecules with appropriate amount of ions (see Table~1 in the main text).
The Berger force field was used for the POPC~\cite{berger97}, with the dihedral potential next to the double bond 
taken from~\cite{bachar04}. The ion parameters from ffmgx~\cite{straatsma88} were used.
Timestep of 2~fs was used with leap-frog integrator. Covalent bond lengths were constrained with LINCS algorithm~\cite{hess97,hess07}. 
Coordinates were written every 10~ps. PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} with real space cut-off at 1.0~nm was used 
for electrostatics. Plain cut-off was used for the Lennard-Jones interactions with a 1.0~nm cut-off.
The neighbour list was updated every 5th step with cut-off at 1.0~nm. Temperature was coupled separately
for lipids, water and ions to 298~K with the velocity-rescale method~\cite{bussi07} with coupling constant 0.1~ps$^{-1}$.
Pressure was semi-isotropically coupled to the atmospheric pressure with the Parrinello--Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello81}.

{\it DPPC:} The simulation without ions is the same as in~\cite{botan15} and the files are available at~\cite{bergerDPPCfiles}.
The initial configuration contained 72 DPPC lipids and 2880 SPC water molecules.
The standard Berger DPPC force field was used ~\cite{berger97} (simulations indicated as Berger-DPPC-97 in Table~1 in the main text). 
The electrostatics were handled with PME~\cite{darden93,essman95}, with real-space Coulomb cut-off set at 1.0 nm. Lennard-Jones potentials were cut off at 1.0 nm. The neighbour list for all non-bonded interactions was updated every 10 steps. 
Temperature was set to 323K with the velocity-rescale method~\cite{bussi07} using a coupling constant of 0.1 ps$^{-1}$.  Semi-isotropic pressure coupling at 1 atm was handled with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello81} with 1 ps coupling constant. The time step was 4 fs, and coordinates were written every 10 ps. The total simulation time was 120 ns (without pre-equilibration) and last 60 ns was used in the order parameter analysis. 

For simulations with added salt, the appropriate number of SPC water molecules were randomly replaced with ions. Ions were described by the ffgmx parameters \cite{straatsma88}. In simulations with scaled charges, charge-scaling was applied by scaling the ion charges  by a factor 0.7. Conditions in the ion simulations were as with the pure DPPC described above. The duration of the simulations was 120 ns (without pre-equilibration) and last 60 ns was used in the order parameter analysis.

All the simulation files for pure DPPC simulations can be found at Ref.~\citenum{bergerDPPCfiles} and for the simulations with ions 
at Refs.~\citenum{bergerDPPC150mMfiles, bergerDPPC1000mMfiles} 
and with scaled ions at Refs.~\citenum{DPPCBergerNaCl150mMscaled, DPPCBergerNaCl1000mMscaled}.



\subsubsection{BergerOPLS}
For simulations without ions, the initial configuration contains 72 DPPC lipids and 2880 SPC water molecules. For simulations with added salt, the appropriate amount of SPC water molecules were randomly replaced with ions. The number of ions is reported in Table~1 in the main text.
For the lipids, we used the same version of Berger force field as in previous simulations, described in \cite{berger97}; for the ions, we used the \r{A}qvist parameters \cite{aqvist90} (commonly used within the OPLS-AA force field). Issues related to the compatibility between Berger and OPLS-AA force fields are described in ref.~\cite{tieleman06}. 
A set of simulations was carried out using reduced electrostatic charges on the ions; in this case, a charge of 0.7 e was used on the ions, as described in refs.~\cite{kohagen16, leontyev11}. Except for the ion force field, all simulation parameters (for non-bonded interactions, integration time step, thermostat, etc.) were identical to the parameters used in the Berger DPPC simulations described above.

All simulation files can be found at Ref.~\citenum{bergerOPLSDPPCfiles} for pure DPPC simulations, 
at Refs.~\citenum{bergerOPLSDPPCfiles150mMnacl, bergerOPLSDPPCfiles1000mMnacl} for simulations with ions,

\subsubsection{CHARMM36}
{\it POPC with NaCl:}
The simulation without ions is taken directly from Refs.~\citenum{botan15,charmm36filesSHORT}. 
The starting structures for simulations with NaCl were made by replacing randomly located 
water molecules of the structure of pure POPC simulation with appropriate amount of ions.
The force field for lipid were the same as in Refs.~\citenum{botan15,charmm36filesSHORT}.
The compatible TIP3P parameters for CHARMM36 and ion parameters with NBFIX by Venable et al.~\cite{venable13} were used.
Simulations were ran with Gromacs 4.5.5 software~\cite{pronk13}.
Timestep of 2~fs was used with leap-frog integrator. Covalent bonds with hydrogens were constrained with LINCS algorithm~\cite{hess97,hess07}. 
Coordinates were written every 5~ps. PME with real space cut-off 1.4~nm was used 
for electrostatics. Lennard-Jones interactions were switched to zero between 0.8~nm and 1.2~nm.
The neighbour list was updated every 5th step with cut-off 1.4~nm. Temperature was coupled separately
for lipids and solution to 303~K with the velocity-rescale method~\cite{bussi07} with coupling constant 0.2~ps.
Pressure was semi-isotropically coupled to the atmospheric pressure with the Berendsen method~\cite{berendsen84}.

Simulation without NBFIX~\cite{venable13} was ran with the same settings, except that 
the temperature was kept at 310~K with Nos{\'e}--Hoover~\cite{nose84,hoover85} thermostat 
(simulation files available at Ref.~\citenum{charmmPOPC350mMNaClnoNBFIXfiles}). 

%CaCl_2 simulations by MYKHAILO:
{\it POPC with CaCl$_2$:}
The starting structures with varying amounts of CaCl$_2$ were constructed using the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder (http://www.charmm-gui.org/) online tool~\cite{lee15}. 
All runs were performed with Gromacs 5.0.3 software package~\cite{abraham15} and CHARMM36 additive force field parameters for lipids~\cite{klauda10} and ions were obtained from CHARMM-GUI input files. 
Simulation parameters provided by CHARMM-GUI were used.
Particularly, the lengths of the bonds involving hydrogens were constrained with LINCS~\cite{hess97,hess07}. The temperatures of the 
lipids and the solvent were separately coupled to the Nose--Hoover~\cite{nose84,hoover85} thermostat with a target temperature of 303 K and a relaxation time constant of 1.0 ps. Semi-isotropical 
pressure coupling to 1 bar was obtained with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 5 ps. Equations of motion were integrated with the Verlet algorithm~\cite{pall13} 
using a timestep of 2 fs. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} method with a fourth order smoothing spline. A real space cut-off of 1.2 nm 
was employed with grid spacing of 0.12 nm in the reciprocal space. Lennard-Jones interactions were smoothly switched to zero between 1.0 nm and 1.2 nm. Verlet cutoff-scheme~\cite{pall13}  
was used with the long-range neighbour list updated every 20 steps. Coordinates were written every 10 ps.
After energy minimisation and an equilibration run of 0.5 ns, 200 ns simulations were ran and the last 100 ns of each simulation was employed for the analysis.

 % DPPC + CaCl2 by Sergey Vilov and Claire Loison, 
 % Ca2+ model from  http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bip.22868 (Jejoong Yoo and Aksimentiev, Oleksii) 
{\it DPPC with CaCl$_2$ (Yoo model):}
The systems contained 128 DPPC lipids and about 7600 TIP3P~\cite{jorgensen83} water molecules,
and an appropriate amount of ions as indicated in  Table~1 in the main text.  
We have used CHARMM36 additive force field parameters for lipids~\cite{klauda10} with compatible TIP3P water model. 
In the calcium model developed recently by Yoo et al.~\cite{yoo16}, 
each cation is decorated by seven hydrating water molecules (with different charges from the usual TIP3P),
which are constrained to remain in its vicinity. The associated parameter files are available
on \url{http://bionano.physics.illinois.edu/CUFIX}. The constraint on the calcium-oxygen distances
was imposed by adding extra bonds through a harmonic potential $V(r) = k(r-r_0)^2$, 
with $r_0=2.25$~\AA~ and $k=10$~kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$$\cdot$\AA$^{-2}$.
 
The starting  configuration of hydrated lipidic bilayers were constructed using {\it packmol} \cite{packmol} 
with a large area per lipid (64~\AA$^{2}$). 
After a first energy minimisation (5000 steps),
varying amounts of Ca$^{2+}$ and Cl$^-$ ions were added  by replacing water molecules,
using the {\it autoionize} plugin of vmd package \cite{hump96},
mentioning explicitly the ion concentration.
Ion placement is random, with the constraint of  minimum 2~\AA~ between ions and lipids,
as well as between any two ions. A second energy minimisation was performed after inserting the ions.
 
All the minimisation and dynamics were conducted using the NAMD package~\cite{NAMD}.
The temperature of the whole system was controlled with Langevin thermostat with a target temperature of 323~K 
and a relaxation time constant of 1~ps.  The modified NAMD version of Nose--Hoover barostat with Langevin dynamics
(piston period of 0.2~ps and piston decay time of 0.05~ps) was used semi-isotropically
for an average target pressure of 1 bar and an average zero surface tension. 
%The ratio of the box length in $x-$ and $y-$ directions was kept fixed to avoid spurious box anisotropy.
%Samuli: This implies from semi-isotropic coupling, right?
The equations of motion were integrated using the multiple time step Verlet r-RESPA algorithm~\cite{pall13}
with a time step of 2~fs, and electrostatic forces calculated only every two time steps. Covalent
bonds between heavy and hydrogen atoms were constrained using SHAKE/RATTLE algorithm.
Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} method 
with a 6-th order smoothing spline and a grid spacing of about 0.1~nm.
A cut-off of 1.2~nm was employed for the Lennard-Jones
interactions, with a force-based switching function for distances beyond 1~nm,
activating the vdwForceSwitching option to ensure NAMD
compatibility with CHARMM force smoothing. Neighbour
lists with a radius of 1.4~nm were updated every 10 timesteps.
Coordinates were written every 20~ps. After energy minimisation, a run of  200~ns simulations was performed,
and the last $\sim$ 170~ns 
of  trajectory was employed for the analysis.
Error bars are defined by $\pm$ the standard error of the mean, 
taking into account the correlation time of the average order parameters 
(200~ps for 430~mM and 400~ps for 890~mM). 


\subsubsection{MacRog}
The simulation parameters are identical to those employed in our earlier study~\cite{botan15} for the full 
hydration and dehydration simulations. The initial structures with varying amounts of NaCl were constructed from an 
extensively hydrated bilayer by replacing water molecules with ions using the Gromacs {\it genion} tool~\cite{gromacsMANUAL}. Even at the highest 
considered salt concentration, the amount of water molecules per lipid after this replacement process was still greater than 50.

\subsubsection{Orange}
The systems contained 72 POPC lipids and 2880 SPC water molecules, and an appropriate amount of ions as indicated in 
Table~1 in the main text.  

For the lipids, we used an unpublished force field coined Orange force field. 
Briefly, this includes most bonded interactions from Berger lipids~\cite{berger97}, 
except for dihedrals which were derived via \textit{ab initio} calculations on small model compounds. 
As in Berger lipids, Lennard-Jones parameters are from OPLS~\cite{jorgensen84,jorgensen86a,jorgensen86b,jorgensen88,briggs91}.
Partial charges were derived on the basis of \textit{ab initio} calculations. 
In simulations with ions, the \r{A}qvist parameters were used~\cite{aqvist90}. 
The electrostatics were handled with PME~\cite{darden93,essman95}, with real-space Coulomb cut-off set at 1.8 nm. 
Lennard-Jones potentials were cut off at 1.8 nm. 
The neighbour lists for the calculation of non-bonded forces were updated every 5 steps.

Temperature was set to 298K with the velocity-rescale thermostat~\cite{bussi07} using a coupling constant of 0.1 ps$^{-1}$, and the pressure was set to 1 
bar using the Berendsen weak coupling algorithm~\cite{berendsen84} (compressibility of 4.5$\cdot$10$^{-5}$ bar$^{-1}$, time constant of 1 ps), coupling separately the x-y dimension and the z dimension to obtain a tensionless system. 
A time step of 2 fs was used for the integration (with the leap-frog algorithm), coordinates were written every 100 ps, 
and the total simulation time was 60 ns. 

Simulation files for pure lipid simulations are found at Ref.~\citenum{orangePOPCfiles} and for the simulations with ions at Refs.~\citenum{orangePOPC140mMNaClfiles,orangePOPC510mMNaClfiles,orangePOPC510mMCaClfiles,orangePOPC1000mMNaClfiles}.


\subsubsection{Slipids}
{\it DPPC:} The simulation without ions from Ref.~\citenum{botan15}, available at Ref.\citenum{slipidsFILES}, was used. 
For the simulation with 150~mM NaCl, the starting DPPC lipid bilayer, which was built with the online CHARMM-GUI~\cite{lee15}
(http://www.charmm-gui.org/), contained 600 lipids hydrated by 30 water molecules per lipid. 

For the simulation with 850~mM NaCl, the configuration from Ref.~\citenum{slipidsFILES} was taken and 
an appropriate amount of water molecules was converted to ions to form a neutral NaCl solution. 
The simulation files are available at Ref.~\citenum{slipidsFILESdppc}. 
%
Ion parameters by Roux~\cite{beglov94,roux96}, TIP3P water model~\cite{jorgensen83} and 
Stockholm lipids (Slipids) parameters~\cite{jambeck12,jambeck12b} for phospholipids were used. 
GROMACS software package version 4.5.5 or 5.0.7~\cite{pronk13} was employed for all simulations. 
After energy 
minimisation and a short equilibration run of 50 ps (time step 1~fs), 100 ns production runs were performed using 
a time step of 2~fs with leap-frog integrator. All covalent bonds were constrained with the LINCS~\cite{hess97,hess07}
algorithm. Coordinates were written every 100 ps. PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} with real space cut-off at 1.0 nm was used for Coulomb 
interactions. Lennard-Jones interactions were switched to zero between 1.0 nm and 1.4 nm. The neighbour 
lists were updated every 10$^\mathrm{th}$ step with a cut-off of 1.6 nm. Temperature was coupled separately for upper and 
bottom leaflets of the lipid bilayer, and for water to 323 K with the Nos\'e-Hoover thermostat~\cite{nose84,hoover85} using 
a time constant of 0.5 ps. Pressure was semi-isotropically coupled to the atmospheric pressure 
with the Parrinello-Rahman~\cite{parrinello81} barostat using a time constant of 10 ps.


{\it POPC:} The simulation without ions from Ref.~\citenum{botan15}, available at Ref.~\citenum{slipidsFILESpopc} was used. \\
{\it POPC with NaCl:}
A POPC bilayer consisting of 200 lipids, hydrated with 45 water molecules per lipid, 
was simulated in the presence of 130 mM NaCl. 
The Slipids model \cite{jambeck12,jambeck12b}
was employed for lipids, the TIP3P model \cite{jorgensen83} for water, and the ion parameters by Smith 
and Dang \cite{smith94} for NaCl. The system was first
equilibrated for 5~ns with a time step of 1~fs after which a 100~ns production run was performed using
a time step of 2~fs. Trajectories were written every 100~ps. The system was kept in a tensionless state at 1~bar 
using a semi-isotropic Parrinello--Rahman barostat \cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 1~ps. 
The temperature was maintained at 310~K
with the velocity rescaling thermostat \cite{bussi07}. The time constant was set to 0.5~ps for both lipids and 
solvent (water and ions) which were coupled separately. Non-bonded interactions were calculated
within a neighbour list with a radius of 1~nm and an update interval of 10 steps. The Lennard-Jones
interactions were cut-off at 1~nm, whereas PME \cite{darden93,essman95} was employed for long-range electrostatics. 
Dispersion correction was applied to both energy and pressure. All bonds were constrained with the LINCS \cite{hess97,hess07}.
algorithm. \\
{\it POPC with CaCl$_2$:} A POPC bilayer consisting of 200 lipids, hydrated with 45 water molecules per lipid, 
was simulated in the presence of 450 mM CaCl$_2$. The system was ran for 2000~ns and the last 100~ns was used 
for analysis. Other details are as in POPC with NaCl.


\subsubsection{Lipid14}
The starting structures with varying amounts of ions were constructed using the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder (http://www.charmm-gui.org/) 
online tool~\cite{lee15}. The GROMACS compatible force field parameters generated in Ref.~\citenum{botan15} and 
available at Ref.~\citenum{lipid14files} were used. 
The TIP3P water model~\cite{jorgensen83} was used to solvate the system and \r{A}qvist \cite{aqvist90} parameters were used for ions.
All runs were performed with Gromacs 5.0.3 software package~\cite{abraham15}
and LIPID14 force field parameters for POPC~\cite{dickson14}. 

H-bond lengths were constrained with LINCS~\cite{hess97,hess07}. The temperatures of the lipids and the solvent were separately coupled to the 
Nose--Hoover~\cite{nose84,hoover85} thermostat with a target temperature of 298.15 K and a relaxation time constant of 0.1 ps. Semi-isotropic pressure 
coupling to 1 bar was obtained with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 2 ps. Equations of motion were integrated 
with the Verlet algorithm~\cite{pall13} using a timestep of 2 fs. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} method 
with a fourth order smoothing spline. A real space cut-off at 1.0 nm was employed with grid spacing of 0.12 nm in the reciprocal space. 
Lennard-Jones potentials were cut-off at 1 nm, with a dispersion correction applied to both energy and pressure. Verlet cutoff-scheme~\cite{pall13} 
were used with the long-range neighbour list updated every 20 steps. Coordinates were written every 10 ps.

After energy minimisation and an equilibration run of 5 ns, 200 ns production runs were performed and analysed. In case of the CaCl$_2$ systems 
only the last 100 ns of each simulation was employed for the analysis.

\subsubsection{Ulmschneiders}
The starting structures with varying amounts of ions were constructed using the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder (\url{http://www.charmm-gui.org}) 
online tool~\cite{lee15}. The force field parameters were obtained from Lipidbook~\cite{domanski10}. The TIP3P water model~\cite{jorgensen83} 
was used to solvate the system.  Additionally, the simulations of ion-free bilayer were repeated with both Verlet and Group cutoff-schemes~\cite{ulmschneiderPOPC0mMNaClfiles}. 
There was no significant difference in headgroup or glycerol backbone order parameters between these cutoff-schemes. All runs were performed with Gromacs 5.0.3 software package~\cite{abraham15}. 
The glycerol backbone order parameters without ions were not the same as reported in the previous study~\cite{botan15}.
The origin of discrepancy was located to the different initial structures which was taken from CHARMM-GUI in this work
and from Lipidbook in the previous work. Since the order parameters with the initial structure from CHARMM-GUI are
closer to the experimental values, the results indicate that the structure available from Lipidbook is stuck to a
state with incorrect glycerol backbone structure, for more discussion see \url{https://github.com/NMRLipids/lipid_ionINTERACTION/issues/8}.

All-bond lengths were constrained with LINCS~\cite{hess97,hess07}. The temperatures of the lipids and the solvent were separately coupled to the Nose--Hoover~\cite{nose84,hoover85} 
thermostat with a target temperature of 298.15 K and a relaxation time constant of 0.1 ps. Semi-isotropic pressure coupling to 1 bar was obtained 
with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 2 ps. Equations of motion were integrated with the Verlet algorithm~\cite{pall13} using a 
timestep of 2 fs. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} method with a fourth order smoothing spline. 
A real space cut-off at 1.0 nm was employed with grid spacing of 0.12 nm in the reciprocal space. Lennard-Jones potentials were cut-off at 1 nm, 
with a dispersion correction applied to both energy and pressure. Verlet cutoff-scheme~\cite{pall13} were used with the long-range neighbour list updated 
every 20 steps. Coordinates were written every 10 ps. After energy minimisation and an equilibration run of 5 ns, 200 ns simulations were ran and 
the last 100 ns of each simulation was employed for the analysis.
