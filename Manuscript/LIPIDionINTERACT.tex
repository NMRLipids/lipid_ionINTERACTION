\begin{abstract}
Despite the vast amount of experimental and theoretical studies, the binding affinity of cations, especially the 
biologically relevant Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ ions, into a phosholipid bilayer is not agreed on in the literature. 
Here we show that the ion binding affinity can be directly compared between simulations and experiments by 
using the choline headgroup order parameters according to the 'molecular electrometer' concept.~\cite{scherer89}.

Our results strongly support the traditional view that Na$^+$ ions and other monovalent ions
(bar Li$^+$) do not specifically bind to phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers with mM concentrations, 
in contrast to Ca$^{2+}$ and other multivalent ions. Especially the Na$^+$ binding affinity is 
overestimated by several molecular dynamics simulation models, leading to an artificially positively
charged lipid bilayer. Qualitatively correct headgroup order parameter response is observed with
Ca$^{2+}$ binding in all the tested models, however, none of the tested models has sufficient 
quantitative accuracy to interpret the Ca$^{2+}$:lipid stoichiometry or the induced atomistic resolution structural changes.

\section{Introduction}

The interaction of cations with phospholipid membranes is important in many physiological processes, 
nerve cell signalling being the prime example.
For this reason such interactions have been widely studied via experiments, simulations, and theory. 
While it is generally agreed that the relative binding affinity of different
ions follows the Hofmeister series~\cite{eisenberg79,cevc90,tocanne90,binder02,celma07,leontidis09,vacha09a,klasczyk10,harb13}, 
no consensus emerges from the literature on the quantitative binding affinities of different ions to phospholipid bilayers. 
Two extensive reviews covering work done prior to 1990~\cite{cevc90,tocanne90}
concluded that monovalent cations interact only weakly with phospholipid bilayers (with the exception of Li$^+$), 
while for multivalent ions the interactions are significant. This conclusion has been supported by
further studies showing that bilayer properties remain unaltered upon addition of millimolar concentrations of monovalent 
salt~\cite{binder02,pabst07,filippov09}. 
On the other hand, the weakness of interactions between phospholipids and monovalent ions
has been questioned in several experimental and molecular dynamics simulation 
studies~\cite{bockmann03,bockmann04,vacha09a,manyes05,manyes06,fukuma07,leontidis09,ferber11,morata12,klasczyk10,harb13}
suggesting stronger binding especially for Na$^{+}$ ions.

More specifically, millimolar concentrations of NaCl have a negligible effect on the
choline head group order parameters~\cite{akutsu81}, area per molecule~\cite{pabst07}, dipole potential~\cite{clarke99},
and lipid lateral diffusion~\cite{filippov09}; in contrast, these properties are significantly affected by the presence
of CaCl$_2$ or other multivalent ions. 
% [reference to be added?]
In addition, water sorption isotherms are very similar for POPC/NaCl system and NaCl in pure water
---indicating only weak interaction between ion and lipids~\cite{binder02}.
Further, only minor changes in POPC infrared spectra are observed in the presence of NaCl,
while changes are significant in the presence of Ca$^{2+}$ and other multivalent ions, 
also confirming that interaction between Na$^+$ and lipids are weak~\cite{binder02}.
In contrast, the decrease in rotational and translational dynamics of fluorescent probes in lipid bilayers with mM NaCl concentrations
suggests significant Na$^{+}$ binding~\cite{bockmann03,vacha09a,harb13}. However, the reduced lateral diffusion is not observed
in noninvasive NMR experiments, suggesting that fluorescence results arise from Na$^{+}$ interactions with probes rather than with 
lipids~\cite{filippov09}. Also the interpretation of calorimetric measurements has been controversial. 
The effect of monovalent ions (bar Li$^+$)  on phase transition temperature is small, 
compared to the effect of multivalent ions; this was initially interpreted by Cevc as an indication that 
only multivalent ions and Li$^+$ specifically bind to phosholipid bilayers~\cite{cevc90}; 
however, more recently such small effect was interpreted as an indication that 
also Na$^+$ binds to lipid membranes~\cite{bockmann03,klasczyk10}.
In electrophoresis measurements on phosphatidylcholine vesicles, 
NaCl increases the (initially negative) zeta potential to about zero; 
however, positive zeta potentials can be generally reached only with multivalent ions 
or Li$^+$~\cite{eisenberg79,tatulian87,manyes05,manyes06,klasczyk10}. 
The lack of significant positive electrophoretic mobility in the presence of NaCl suggests weak binding of Na$^+$; 
however, the same data can also be explained by the effect of Cl$^-$ ions~\cite{berkowitz06,knecht13}.
Finally, changes in bilayer hardness and area per lipid measured with Atomistic Force Microscopy (AFM)
were interpreted as Na$^{+}$ binding to phospholipids~\cite{manyes05,manyes06,fukuma07,ferber11,morata12}.

Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful tool to interpret experimental data in terms of atomic-level interactions.
In atomistic MD simulations, the majority of commonly used models predicts binding of Na${^+}$ ions 
to phoshatidylcholine lipid bilayers, 
but the strength of binding depends on the specific model used~\cite{bockmann03,bockmann04,sachs04,berkowitz06,cordomi09,valley11,berkowitz12}. 
%Generally the CHARMM based force fields predict less Na$^+$ binding and changes in bilayer
%properties than the GROMOS based force fields~\cite{sachs04,valley11}.
Some simulation studies confirmed a reduction in lipid lateral diffusion due to Na$^+$ binding, 
in agreement with fluorescent probe measurements~\cite{bockmann03,vacha09a,harb13} 
but in contrast with NMR experiments~\cite{filippov09}. 
Other simulations showed a reduction in area per lipid in the presence of NaCl, 
in agreement with AFM experiments~\cite{manyes05,manyes06,fukuma07,ferber11,morata12};
however, the reduction in area was observed at excessively low Na$^+$ concentrations, 
compared to observations from scattering experiments~\cite{pabst07}.
Predictions of electrophoretic mobility in the presence of NaCl yielded positive values, higher than in experiments; 
however, this could be explained by the behaviour of Cl$^-$ ions~\cite{berkowitz06,knecht13}.

In the present work we set out to solve the apparent contradictions 
by directly comparing the headgroup hydrocarbon segment
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ (see Fig. \ref{POPCstructure}) order parameters between simulations
and experiments as a function of cation concentration. 
According to the 'molecular electrometer' concept, changes in order parameters of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons 
in the phospholipid head group can be used to measure the ion affinity to the 
phophatidylcholine (PC) lipid bilayer~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87,scherer89}.
Order parameters can be accurately measured in experiments and straightforwardly compared to 
simulations \cite{ollila15}, therefore the molecular electrometer allows the 
comparison of binding affinity between simulations and experiments. 
We show that the response of order parameters to penetrating cations 
is qualitatively correct in simulations, but the affinity of PC bilayers for Na$^{+}$ ions 
is significantly overestimated in several MD simulation models. 
Moreover, we show that the accuracy of tested models does not allow for
an interpretation of lipid--Ca$^{2+}$ interactions with atomistic resolution.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Molecular electrometer concept in experiments}\label{conceptinexperiments}
According to the molecular electrometer concept the binding of charged objects on 
PC bilayer interface induce systematic changes in choline $\beta$ and $\alpha$
segment order parameters. Thus, the changes of these order parameters can be used
to determine binding affinities of the charged objects. The concept is originally
based on experimentally observed changes in choline order parameters with bound 
cations~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84}, see Fig. \ref{ordPions} for data as a function
of ion concentration in solution. 
\begin{figure*}[]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{../Fig/OrderParameterIONSchanges.eps}
  \caption{\label{ordPions}
    The order parameter changes for $\beta$ and $\alpha$ segments as a function of NaCl (left column) 
    and CaCl$_2$ (right column) concentration, from simulations and experiments~\cite{akutsu81} 
    (POPC with CaCl$_2$ from \cite{altenbach84}). The signs of the experimental order parameters, taken from
    experiments without ions~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}, can be assumed to be unchanged 
    with concentrations represented here~\cite{altenbach84,ollila15}. 
    It should be noted that none of the models used here reproduces the order parameters
within experimental error for pure PC bilayer without ions, indicating structural inaccuracies with varying severity in all
models \cite{botan15} %this is important to say, otherwise someone might get wrong impression from this fig.
   }
\todo{We should figure out how to present and discuss the CHARMM results with shorter simulation times.}
\end{figure*}

Further quantification with various positively 
and negatively charged molecules showed that choline order parameters vary linearly 
with small amount of bound charge per lipid~\cite{altenbach84,altenbach85,seelig87,macdonald87,scherer89,roux90,beschiasvili91,marassi92,rydall92}.
%Since the quadrupolar splitting is $\Delta\nu_i^{\rm{Q}}=-\frac{3}{4} \chi S_{\rm{CD}}$
%and $S_{\rm{CD}} \approx S_{\rm{CH}}$~\cite{ollila16} 
The relation between bound charge per lipid $X^\pm$ and choline order parameters can be then written as~\cite{ferreira16}
\begin{equation}\label{electrometer_eq}
S_{\rm{CH}}^{(i)}(X^\pm)=S_{\rm{CH}}^{(i)}(0) + \frac{4}{3}\chi^{-1}m_i X^\pm,
\end{equation}
where the quadrupole coupling constant $\chi$ is approximately equal to 167 kHz,
$S_{\rm{CH}}^{(i)}(0)$ is order parameter without bound charges, $m_i$
is constant depending on the valency and position of bound charge, and $i$
refers to either $\alpha$ or $\beta$.
Combination of atomic absorption spectra and $^2$H NMR experiments gave $m_\alpha=-20.5$ 
and $m_\beta=-10.0$ for Ca$^{2+}$ binding in POPC bilayer~\cite{altenbach84}.
%With these values the Eq.~\ref{electrometer_eq} gives
%\begin{equation}\label{alphaCH}
%\Delta S_{\rm CH}^\alpha=-0.16 X^{\rm Ca^{2+}}
%\end{equation}
%and
%\begin{equation}\label{betaCH}
%\Delta S_{\rm CH}^\beta=-0.08 X^{\rm Ca^{2+}},
%\end{equation}
%where $X^{\rm Ca^{2+}}$ is the amount of bound Ca$^{2+}$ per lipid.
%Order parameter changes a function of bound charges from Eqs. \ref{alphaCH} and
%\ref{betaCH} are shown in Fig.~\ref{electrometer}. 

In original experiments the absolute values of order parameters 
increased for $\beta$ and decreased for $\alpha$ segment with bound positive charge
and {\it vice versa} for negative charge~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,altenbach85,seelig87,scherer89,rydall92}. 
However, more recent experiments showed that 
$\beta$ carbon order parameter is negative while $\alpha$ carbon order parameter is 
positive~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}. Thus, we can conclude 
that $\beta$ and $\alpha$ segment order parameters decrease with bound positive charges 
and increase with bound negative charge. Consequently, values of $m_i$ are negative for
bound positive charges and {\it vice versa}. This can be rationalized by electrostatically 
induced changes in choline P-N dipole tilt \cite{seelig87,scherer89,seelig90}. 
This is in line with order parameter decrease related to the P-N vector tilting more parallel to membrane plane 
seen with decreased hydration levels~\cite{botan15}. 

%, and positive to the 
%sign to the order parameter of the 
%carbon
%thus both order parameter values are actually decreasing %(becoming more negative) 
%as the concentration of cations increases~\cite{ollila15}. 
%Combining extensive quantitifaction of electrometer concept with
%were measured \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87,scherer89}
%order current knowledge on order parameter signs~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}, 

The headgroup order parameter changes as a function of ion concentration in
solution from H$^2$ NMR experiments are shown in Fig.~\ref{ordPions} for DPPC and POPC bilayers~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84}.
%with correct signs~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}, 
%as a function NaCl and CaCl$_2$ concentration. 
In contrast to the response as a function of bound charge in 
Eq. \ref{electrometer_eq}, the changes in Fig. \ref{ordPions}
are not linear. This can be explained by electrostatic repulsion between
already bound Calcium ions and ions in solution \cite{altenbach84}.
Experimental data in Fig. \ref{ordPions} shows only minor changes in order
parameter as a function of NaCl is solution, 
while the effect of CaCl$_2$ is an order of magnitude larger. 
Thus, according to the molecular electrometer concept, 
monovalent Na$^+$ ions have negligible affinity for PC lipid bilayers at concentrations up to 1 M,
while binding of Ca$^{2+}$ ions at the same concentration is significant~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84}. 
This conclusion is in agreement with several other experimental 
studies~\cite{cevc90,tocanne90,binder02,pabst07,filippov09}.

\subsection{Molecular electrometer concept in MD simulations}\label{electrometerinsimulations}

Figure~\ref{ordPions} also reports order parameter changes calculated from MD simulations
of DPPC and POPC lipid bilayers as a function of NaCl or CaCl$_2$ concentrations in solution. 
Details of the simulated systems are reported in Table~\ref{IONsystems} and in Supplementary Information. 
It should be noted that none of the models used here 
reproduced the order parameters within experimental uncertainty
for pure PC bilayer without ions in our previous study (Figure 2 in Ref. \cite{botan15}), 
indicating structural inaccuracies with varying severity for all models \cite{botan15}.
%\todo{MONTICELLI: hmm, I see a little problem here: the absolute values for the order parameters are not reported here,
% so how can we notice that they don't match the experiment? 
% Is it worth having another figure? If not, then I will rephrase this bit above, I don't think it's very clear. \\
%OLLILA: This is shown in the reference, i.e. in NMRlipids I paper. There is some discussion 
%in the GitHub issue if we should have figure showing the order parameter without ions or not.\\
%https://github.com/NMRLipids/lipid\_ionINTERACTION/issues/3 }
On the other hand, the experimentally observed headgroup order parameter increase with dehydration
was qualitatively reproduced by all the tested models \cite{botan15}. 
Accordingly, the presense of cations in simulations leads to the decrease 
of choline order parameters in Fig. \ref{ordPions}, which is in qualitative
agreement with experiments. However, the changes are overestimated in most
simulation results in Fig \ref{ordPions}. 

According to the electrometer concept the order parameter changes are proportional to
the amount of bound cations in bilayer, see section \ref{conceptinexperiments}.
The order parameter changes as a function of bound charge from simulations are
shown in Fig. \ref{electrometer}. Roughly linear correlation between bound charge
and order parameter change is found in all simulation models, which is in line with
experiments \cite{altenbach84}. However, there are some differences in the 
proportionality constans (i.e. slopes in Fig. \ref{electrometer}) between different
models; especially MacRog and Orange models give relatively steep slopes and CHARMM
gives gentle slope for $\alpha$ carbon. The quantitative comparison to experimental
slopes ( $m_\alpha=-20.5$ and $m_\beta=-10.0$ for Ca$^{2+}$ binding in POPC bilayer in 
Eq. \ref{electrometer_eq}~\cite{altenbach84}) is not straightforward since the results
from simulations depends on the definition of bound ions. Thus the more detailed analysis 
is left for further studies.

  \caption{\label{electrometer}

\todo{Results from long CHARMM and Slipids simulations to be added.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{electrometer} shows that order parameter decrease clearly correlates with
amount of bound cations also in simulations. This is also evident from Fig.~\ref{NAdensities}
showing Na$^+$ density profiles from the different simulation models. 
In the figure, simulation models are ordered according to the order parameter changes 
(reported Fig.~\ref{ordPions}), from the smallest to the largest.
The Na$^+$ density peaks are larger for models with larger changes in order parameters,
in line with observed correlation between cation binding and order parameter decrease in
Fig. \ref{electrometer}.

In conclusion, the observed clear correlation between bound cations and order parameter
decrease support the validity of the molecular electrometer in simulations. Thus, the 
choline order parameter changes can be used to directly compare the cation binding affinity
between simulations and experiments.

\subsection{Cation binding in different simulation models}
The order parameter changes and density distributions in Figs.~\ref{ordPions} and \ref{NAdensities} 
with added NaCl show significantly different Na$^+$ binding affinities for different simulation models.
The best agreement with experiments (i.e., lowest order parameter changes) is observed for the Orange,
CHARMM36 and Lipid14 models (see Figs.~\ref{ordPions}). These also predict the lowest Na$^+$ densities 
in the proximity of the membrane (see Fig.~\ref{NAdensities}). Since the order parameter changes with NaCl 
in these three models are small (less than 0.02), we cannot conclude with the achieved accuracy which of 
these three models has the most realistic Na$^+$ binding affinity, especially with physiological NaCl concentrations ($\sim$ 150mM) 
which is relevant for most applications. 

%While the predicted changes in order parameters for these three models are very similar,
%the ion density profiles show differences in Na$^+$ affinity, Orange having lowest affinity and CHARMM36 the highest. 
%With the achieved accuracy for the order parameters we are not able to conclude 
% is this correct? the numbers at low NaCl concentrations are difficult to read.
% SAMULI: Almost all the points are within the error bars. One could say that CHARMM is maybe 
% changing more than others, then there is this weird one point in ORANGE, etc. 
% I think it is beyond the scope to start distinguish these three models since
% in that case we should run more to get smaller error bars and do many other things
% more carefully as well

%\todo{I DID NOT GET THIS: \\
%On one hand, it is clear that models in better agreement with experimental  data on order parameters
%show low Na$^+$ binding affinity, as reported in a number of experiments. 
%On the other hand, differences in ion binding affinities raise questions on the quantitative application 
%of the molecular electrometer in molecular simulations.\\
%IF YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BEST THREE MODELS, I THINK THE
%PROBLEM TO DISINGUISH IS TOO LARGE ERROR BARS IN SIMULATIONS, NOT THE ELECTROMETER
%CONCEPT ITSELF (WHICH MAY BE THE SAME WHAT IS MENT HERE). ANYWAY, I THINK THAT THESE 
%SENTENCES ARE NOT NEEDED, UNLESS I HAVE MISSED SOMETHING IMPORTANT?
%Sorry about writing capitals. SAMULI}

On the other hand, the choline order parameter changes with NaCl are clearly overestimated in all the other tested models (see Fig.~\ref{ordPions}).
This can be explained by unrealistically strong Na$^+$ binding affinity to the bilayer in these models (see Fig.~\ref{NAdensities}). 
Such observation raises questions on the quality of the predictions from these models when NaCl is present.
%reported in a number of simulation papers... [complete with examples] 
\todo{It has been suggested that we should add references here. The problem is that there are a lot of them and
it is difficult to choose which ones to pick. Any opinions?}
Especially interactions between charged molecules and lipid bilayer might be significantly
affected since strong Na$^+$ binding makes bilayer effectively positively charged.

As a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration all the tested models overestimate the order parameter decrease, 
as seen in Fig.~\ref{ordPions}. According to the electrometer concept this indicates overestimated
Ca$^{2+}$ binding. On the other hand, the result could be also explained by the oversensitivity of the
choline structure on bound Ca$^{2+}$, i.e. too strong slopes in Fig.~\ref{electrometer}. 
We cannot fully exclude this possibility since the quantitative comparison with experimental slope is
not possible with current data as discussed in section~\ref{electrometerinsimulations}.
In this case the bindiging affinitity could be correct but the overestimated choline structural response 
would induce too large order parameter changes. The latter explanation may be relevant especially in
the case of Orange model which gives steeper slope in Fig.~\ref{electrometer} than other models.

The ion density distributions with CaCl$_2$ in Fig.~\ref{CAdensitiesCLEAR} show significant
Ca$^{2+}$ binding in all models, however, some difference occur between different models.
The Berger model predicts deeper penetration depth (density maxima close to $\pm$1.8~nm) compared
to other models (density maxima close to $\pm$2~nm). The latter value is probably more realistic 
since $^1$H~NMR and neutron scattering data indicates that Ca$^{2+}$ interacts mainly with the 
choline group~\cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84,cevc90}. In CHARMM36 model almost all Ca$^{2+}$
ions present in simulation bind in bilayer indicating strongest binding affinity among the tested
models. On the other hand, CHARMM36 $\alpha$ carbon order parameters are least sensitive to bound
charge (Fig.~\ref{electrometer}), thus the difference is not as clear in Fig.~\ref{ordPions}.
%Further, the $^1$H~NMR experiments suggest that the N-$\beta$-$\alpha$-O dihedral is only in 
%gaughe-conformation in the absence of ions, but in the presence of multivalent ions also anti-conformations
%would occur~\cite{hauser78, hauser81}. However,  in the tested simulation models the glycerol backbone and headgroup atomistic resolution structures
%and their changes are not reproduced within experimental error~\cite{botan15},
%thus model development is needed before Ca$^{2+}$ binding affinity, lipid/ion stoichiometry 
%and concomitant structural changes can be interpreted.
%\todo{The P-N vector tilting analysis should be considered}
%I have now calculated the dihedral distributions for this dihedral with different CaCl$_2$ concentrations in different models, see Fig.~\ref{ObaNdihs}.
%The change suggested by the $^1$H NMR experiments is not seen in the CHARMM36 model. In Orange model this dihedral is mostly in anti
%conformation also without CaCl$_2$, oppositely as suggested by $^1$H NMR experiments. With CaCl$_2$ anti conformations become slightly more
%pronounced, however, the conformation seems to be unrealistic from the beginning so the studies of structural response to the CaCl$_2$
%might not be reasonable with this model. I think we need more simulations with CHARMM36 to see how good the order parameter response
%to the CaCl$_2$ actually is. Then we can discuss more about its structural response.} \\

Significant Ca$^{2+}$ binding affinity to a phosphatidylcholine bilayer at mM concentrations  
is agreed in the literature~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,cevc90,tocanne90}, however, several
details are yet under discussion. Simulations suggest that Ca$^{2+}$ bind to lipid carbonyl
oxygens with coordination number of 4.2~\cite{bockmann04}, while interpretation of NMR and 
scattering experiments suggest that one Ca$^{2+}$ interacts mainly with choline 
groups~\cite{hauser76,hauser78,herbette84} of two phospholipid molecules~\cite{altenbach84}. 
Simulation model correctly reproducing the order parameter changes would resolve the discussion
by giving atomistic resolution interpretation for the experiments.

%, the estimations for lipid/Ca$^{2+}$ stoichiometry vary between 17 
%and 0.24~\cite{tatulian87,altenbach84,bockmann04}. The smallest number (0.24) indicating that one 
%Ca$^{2+}$ ion binds roughly four lipid molecules originates from simulation with Berger model~\cite{bockmann04}.
\todo{Stoichiometry discussion updated.}
%The direct comparison of order parameters between different simulation models and experiments in Fig.~\ref{ordPions}
%shows that Ca$^{2+}$ binding induced changes are overestimated in all tested models.
%In contrast to Na$^+$, clear correlation between Ca$^{2+}$ binding affinity and order parameter changes is not found, 
%thus the overestimation of order parameter change may arise, e.g. from overestimated binding, 
%incorrect headgroup response to penetrating divalent cation or penetration depth. 



The overestimated Na$^+$ binding may originate, e.g., from incorrect choline structure~\cite{botan15}, 
lack of polarizability~\cite{leontyev11}, other discrepancies in the ion models~\cite{hess06,chen07,Reif13} or from
combination of these and other issues. Interestingly, the same ion model and non--bonded parameters
are used in the Orange and BergerOPLS~\cite{tieleman06} simulations, but while Na$^+$ ion binding affinity
is realistic in the Orange model, it is seriously overestimated in the BergerOPLS (Fig.~\ref{NAdensities}). 
This shows that the binding affinity significantly depends on the used lipid parameters. 
On the other hand, Na$^+$ binding with Berger, BergerOPLS and Slipid models is reduced but not yet in agreement with experiments 
when charges on the ions are reduced (to compensate for the lack of electronic polarizability~\cite{kohagen15,leontyev11}, 
see Supplementary Information). 
Further, the Slipid model gives similar binding affinity with two different ion parameters. 
Altogether, these results indicate that at least lipid models need improvement to 
correctly predict the Na$^+$ binding affinity.
The ion model having scaled charges~\cite{kohagen14} used with CHARMM36 did not improve the results, see Supplementary Information.

%The failure of Gromos ions to properly account ion--ion and ion--water binding propensities of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions has been
% reported previously~\cite{Reif13}. The \r{A}qvist ions have been parameterized in aqueous solutions with good agreement
% to experimental energies~\cite{Aaqvist90}. Yet, the binding affinity of ions to lipid bilayers has not been
% calibrated---instead it is assumed to work based purely on forces obtained using combination rules. Compared to Gromos
% ions, \r{A}qvist parameters are better, yet Na$^+$ overbinding still occurs.

\section{Conclusions}
As suggested by the molecular electrometer concept~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87,scherer89},
the decrease in order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in the PC head group of lipids bilayers
is related to cation binding  in all tested simulation models, despite of inaccuracies 
in actual atomistic resolution structures~\cite{botan15}. The concept allows direct comparison
of Na$^+$ binding affinity between simulations and NMR experiments by using changes in the head group order parameter.
The comparison reveals that most models overestimate the Na$^+$ binding; only Orange, Lipid14, and CHARMM36 
predict realistic binding affinity. None of the tested models has the required accuracy to interpret
the Ca$^{2+}$/lipid stoichiometry or induced structural changes with atomistic resolution.

In general, our results support the traditional (pre-2000) view that Na$^+$ and other monovalent ions (bar Li$^+$)
do not specifically bind to the phospholipid bilayer at mM concentrations, in contrast to Ca$^{2+}$ and other multivalent 
ions~\cite{eisenberg79,akutsu81,altenbach84,tatulian87,clarke99,binder02,pabst07,filippov09}.
The contradicting results from previous molecular dynamics simulations~\cite{bockmann03,bockmann04}, 
fluorescent probe dynamics~\cite{bockmann03,vacha09a,harb13}, 
calorimetry~\cite{bockmann03,klasczyk10} and AFM~\cite{manyes05,manyes06,fukuma07,ferber11,morata12}, 
suggesting stronger Na$^+$ binding, can be explained by simulation artefacts, 
direct interactions between Na$^+$ and fluorescent probes~\cite{filippov09}, 
alternative interpretations of the significance of small phase transition temperature shifts~\cite{cevc90}, 
and insufficient resolution of AFM.

The artificial specific Na$^+$ binding in simulations may lead to doubtful results, since it effectively leads  to
positively charged phoshatidylcholine (PC) lipid bilayers even at physiological NaCl concentration.
Such PC bilayer has distinctly different interactions with charged objects compared to the more realistic
model without specific Na$^+$ binding. Furthermore, the overestimation of Na$^+$ binding affinity may
extend also to other positively charged objects, e.g. membrane protein segments. This would affect
lipid protein interactions and could explain contradicting results on electrostatic interactions 
between charged protein segments and lipid bilayer \cite{arkhipov13,kaszuba15}. In conclusion, 
more careful studies and model development on lipid bilayer--charged object interactions are
needed to make molecular dynamics simulations directly usable in physiologically relevant
electrostatic environment. 


%The most straightforward explanation for our results is that Na$^+$ ions do not practically penetrate into a PC lipid bilayer
%at mM concentrations, thus the presense of NaCl does not affect the bilayer properties as observed in various 
%experiments~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,clarke99,binder02,pabst07,filippov09}.
%Consequently, the Na$^+$ penetration and concominant changes in order parameters, area per molecule and lateral diffusion 
%seen in almost all simulation models would be artefact due to overestimated attraction between ions and lipid bilayer.
%Even though this would also explain the absense of positive zeta potential in electrophoresis 
%experiments~\cite{eisenberg79,tatulian87,manyes05,manyes06,klasczyk10},  
%the presented data do not rule out the suggested possibility of equal binding of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions~\cite{knecht13},
%however, this equal binding should happen in such a way that the bilayer properties are unaffected.
%The negligible binding of Na$^+$ at mM concentrations suggested here differs from the conclusions made from 
%measurements of fluorescent probe dynamics~\cite{bockmann03,vacha09a,harb13}, membrane hardness with 
%AFM~\cite{manyes05,manyes06,fukuma07,ferber11,morata12} and calorimetry~\cite{bockmann03,klasczyk10}.
%However, the fluorescent measurement results may arise from direct interactions between probe and ions, as already 
%suggested by Filippov et al.~\cite{filippov09}. 
%Further, the calorimetric results have been also interpreted to support negligible binding~\cite{cevc90}, 
%and AFM result is relatively indirect, thus there may be alternative explanations as well.


%In conclusion, our results show that the Na$^+$ association to PC bilayer is significantly too strong in the Berger and MacRog models,
%while Orange and CHARMM36 force fields predict more realistic binding affinity. Since some modest changes are also seen in 
%Orange and CHARMM36 results, more careful simulation studies would be needed to judge if the Na$^+$ association is slightly 
%too strong also in these  models. The stonger Na$^+$ ion association in GROMOS based force fields compared to CHARMM based force 
%has been already reported in the literature~\cite{berkowitz06,cordomi09,valley11,berkowitz12,sachs04,valley11},
%however the novelty of this work in this respect is that we make a direct comparison
%to the experiments which can be used as measure for the model quality. 

%In situations where a positive charge penetrates into a bilayer (e.g. cationic surfactant~\cite{scherer89} or multivalent ion~\cite{akutsu81}) 
%a decrease in choline order parameters is observed in experiments, as also seen in CaCl$_2$ results in Fig.~\ref{ordPions}.
%Also in all simulations analyzed in this work where cation is penetrating into a bilayer, the choline order parameters
%decrease as seen in Fig.~\ref{ordPions}. However, in the case of CaCl$_2$ the decrease in too pronounced in 
%simulations which may arise from too strong partitioning of Ca$^{2+}$ or overestimated influence of charge on lipid conformation.



%Our discussion gives further support to the idea that choline orientation and ion partitioning can
%be experimentally measured by using the choline group order parameters as suggested in the series of
%publications by Seelig and co workers.
%However, we have updated the details of the relation by including the information about 
%the sings.

%- \todo{Final conclusions about the structural response to be written once we have all the results} 


%In conclusion, the penetrating induced decrease in order parameters can be seen in all models
%independently of the detailed molecular structure in the model, corresponding to the dehydration case
%where increase was seen in all models. The most likely explanation is that, despite of the structural model, the choline group
%orients more parallel to the membrane normal with penetrating cations. In contrast to the dehydration results,
%we are not aware of experimental data for the glycerol order parameters as a function of penetrating ions. 
%Furher, our results show that the Na$^+$ partitioning into a PC bilayer with Berger model is a
%simulation artefact, thus the research lines based these results should be taken with caution.


%This work has been done, and will be progressed, as an open collaboration through nmrlipids.blogspot.fi.






%Similar significant structural changes in the headgroup region are seen upon the addition
%of sodium and calcium ions in the Berger model. This contradicts with the experiments where
%sodium does not change the headgroup structure and the changes observed for calcium are different from those seen in simulations.
%These results indicate that the changes in the headgroup structure due to a permeating charge are not correct
%in the Berger model and, in particular, that sodium ions penetrating the headgroup region is erroneous.

\section{Effect of ion model and polarization}
It has been suggested that the missing electronic polarizability 
can be compensated by scaling the ion charge in simulations~\cite{leontyev11}. 
To test if this would improve the Na$^+$ ion binding behaviour, we ran simulations with Berger-DPPC-97, BergerOPLS-DPPC-06
and Slipids with scaled Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions. For Berger-DPPC-97 and BergerOPLS-DPPC-06 models 
the ion charge in systems listed in Table~\ref{IONsystems} was simply scaled with 0.7 and
the related files are available 
at ~\cite{DPPCBergerNaCl150mMscaled,DPPCBergerNaCl1000mMscaled,DPPCBergerOPLS06NaCl150mMscaled,DPPCBergerOPLS06NaCl1000mMscaled}). 
For simulations with Slipids the ion model by Kohagen et al. was used~\cite{kohagen15} and the related files are 
available at~\cite{slipidsFILESpopcSCALED}. The simulation parameters were identical to those employed in the simulation of POPC with 130~mM NaCl (see Methods).
The order parameter changes and Na$^+$-binding affinity are decreased by the charge scaling but 
yet overestimated with respect to the experiments as seen from Figs. \ref{OPchangesSCALED} and~\ref{NAdensitySCALED}. 
Thus the overestimated binding affinity cannot be fixed by only scaling charges.

\todo{This should be rewritten due to the new data}
We also tested the effect of charge scaling in the case of CaCl$_2$ with CHARMM36 model.
The ion model by Kohagen et al.~\cite{kohagen14} was used  and the related files are 
available at~\cite{charmmFILESpopc450mMcaclSCALED}. Figures~\ref{OPchangesSCALED} and~\ref{CAdensities}
show that the scaling does not improve the CaCl$_2$ binding behaviour respect to the
experiments. The same scaled model with Slipid in the main text also
overestimated the CaCl$_2$ effect. However, the effect of scaling cannot be analyzed in this case since
Slipid simulation was no ran with non-scaled CaCl$_2$ model.



%The intuitive explanation is that by scaling the partial charges the charge discrepancy between the ion and water partial charges is decreased. This means
%that there is a lesser driving force for ions to bind to the highly-charged phosphate group. Furthermore, with
%Berger-DPPC-06 and scaled \r{A}qvist ions (Q=0.7) we obtain that there is only very weak binding of sodium to DPPC as
%observed experimentally (right side of Figure \ref{ionscaled}). In scaled models the order parameter changes 
%are also small. However, the ion concentration is also small. To be fully conclusive, if the affinity can be fixed by scaling,
%we need to run simulations also with large concentrations.


%The results indicate that the polarization effect actually improves ion binding affinities irrespectively of the model.
%However, the drawback of the scaled charges is that the total charge of the simulation box is non-zero whenever
%counterions and charged molecules are present. This may cause simulation artefacts. Even though in methods such as
%PME the residual charge does not affect the forces (and thus dynamics), it still has an effect to the energies.
%This is because the potential from the residual charge is 'smeared in the box' and so depends on the possibly
%fluctuating (at least in NPT conditions) volume of the simulation box.

\subsection{Simulated systems}
All simulations are ran with a standard setup for planar lipid bilayer in zero tension
with periodic boundary conditions with Gromacs software package (version numbers 4.5-X-5.0.X).

\subsection{Analysis}
The order parameters were calculated from simulation trajectories directly applying the equation
$S_{{\rm CH}}=\langle \frac{3}{2}  \cos^2 \theta-\frac{1}{2} \rangle$,
where $\theta$ is the angle between a given C--H bond and the bilayer normal and average is taken
over all lipids and time frames. For united atom models, the positions of hydrogen atoms
were calculated for each molecule in each frame \textit{a posteriori} by using the {\it protonate} tool in 
Gromacs 4.0.2 \cite{gromacsMANUAL402}. 
The statistical error in the order parameter was estimated by calculating the average value separately for each lipid molecule,
and then the average and standard error of the mean over the ensemble of lipids (as done also in previous work \cite{botan15}).
All the scripts used in analysis and the resulting data are available in the GitHub repository \cite{githubIONpaper}

\subsection{Simulation details}

\subsubsection{Berger}
{\it POPC} The simulation without ions is the same as in~\cite{ferreira13} and the files are available at~\cite{bergerFILESpopc}. 
The starting structures for simulations with ions is made by replacing water molecules with appropriate amount of ions (see Table~\ref{IONsystems}).
The Berger force field was used for the POPC~\cite{berger97}, with the dihedral potential next to the double bond 
taken from~\cite{bachar04}. The ion parameters from ffmgx~\cite{straatsma88} were used.
Timestep of 2~fs was used with leap-frog integrator. Covalent bond lengths were constrained with LINCS algorithm~\cite{hess97,hess07}. 
Coordinates were written every 10~ps. PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} with real space cut-off 1.0~nm was used 
for electrostatics. Plain cut-off was used for the Lennard-Jones interactions with a 1.0~nm cut-off.
The neighbour list was updated every 5th step with cut-off 1.0~nm. Temperature was coupled separately
for lipids, water and ions to 298~K with the velocity-rescale method~\cite{bussi07} with coupling constant 0.1~ps$^{-1}$.
Pressure was semi-isotropically coupled to the athmospheric pressure with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello81}.

{\it DPPC} The simulation without ions is the same as in~\cite{botan15} and the files are available at~\cite{bergerDPPCfiles}.
The initial configuration contained 72 DPPC lipids and 2880 SPC water molecules.
The standard Berger DPPC force field was used ~\cite{berger97} (simulations indicated as Berger-DPPC-97 in Table~\ref{IONsystems}). 
The electrostatics were handled with PME~\cite{darden93,essman95}, with real-space Coulomb cut-off set at 1.0 nm. Lennard-Jones potentials were cut off 1.0 nm. The neighborlist for all non-bonded interactions was updated every 10 steps. 
Temperature was set to 323K with the velocity-rescale method~\cite{bussi07} using a coupling constant of 0.1 ps$^{-1}$.  Semi-isotropic pressure coupling at 1 ATM was handled with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello81} with 1 ps coupling constant. The time step was 4 fs, and coordinates were written every 10 ps. The total simulation time was 120 ns (without pre-equilibration) and last 60 ns was used in the order parameter analysis. 

For simulations with added salt, the appropriate number of SPC water molecules were randomly replaced with ions. Ions were described by the ffgmx parameters \cite{straatsma88}. In simulations with scaled charges, charge-scaling was applied by scaling the ion charges  by a factor 0.7. Conditions in the ion simulations were as with the pure DPPC described above. The duration of the simulations was 120 ns (without pre-equilibration) and last 60 ns was used in the order parameter analysis.

All the simulation files for pure DPPC simulations can be found at ~\cite{bergerDPPCfiles} and for the simulations with ions at 
~\cite{bergerDPPC150mMfiles, bergerDPPC1000mMfiles} 
and with scaled ions at ~\cite{DPPCBergerNaCl150mMscaled, DPPCBergerNaCl1000mMscaled}.



\subsubsection{BergerOPLS}
For simulations without ions, the initial configuration contains 72 DPPC lipids and 2880 SPC water molecules. For simulations with added salt, the appropriate amount of SPC water molecules were randomly replaced with ions. The number of ions is reported in Table~\ref{IONsystems}.
For the lipids, we used the same version of Berger force field as in previous simulations, described in \cite{berger97}; for the ions, we used the qvist parameters \cite{aqvist90} (commonly used within the OPLS-AA force field). Issues related to the compatibility between Berger and OPLS-AA force fields are described in ref.~\cite{tieleman06}. 
A set of simulations was carried out using reduced electrostatic charges on the ions; in this case, a charge of 0.7 e was used on the ions, as described in refs.~\cite{kohagen15, leontyev11}. Except for the ion force field, all simulation parameters (for non-bonded interactions, integration time step, thermostat, etc.) were identical to the parameters used in the Berger DPPC simulations described above.

All simulation files can be found at ~\cite{bergerOPLSDPPCfiles} for pure DPPC simulations, 
at ~\cite{bergerOPLSDPPCfiles150mMnacl, bergerOPLSDPPCfiles1000mMnacl} for simulations with ions,
and at ~\cite{DPPCBergerOPLS06NaCl150mMscaled, DPPCBergerOPLS06NaCl1000mMscaled} for simulations with ions with scaled charges. 



\subsubsection{CHARMM36}
{\it POPC with NaCl}
The simulation without ions is taken directly from~\cite{botan15,charmm36filesSHORT}. 
The starting structures for simulations with NaCl were made by replacing randomly located 
water molecules of the structure of pure POPC simulation with appropriate amount of ions.
The force field for lipid were the same as in~\cite{botan15,charmm36filesSHORT}.
The ion parameters with NBFIX by Venable et al.~\cite{venable13} were used.
Simulations were ran with Gromacs 4.5.5 software~\cite{pronk13}.
Timestep of 2~fs was used with leap-frog integrator. Covalent bonds with hydrogens were constrained with LINCS algorithm~\cite{hess97,hess07}. 
Coordinates were written every 5~ps. PME with real space cut-off 1.4~nm was used 
for electrostatics. Lennard-Jones interactions were switched to zero between 0.8~nm and 1.2~nm.
The neighbour list was updated every 5th step with cut-off 1.4~nm. Temperature was coupled separately
for lipids and solution to 303~K with the velocity-rescale method~\cite{bussi07} with coupling constant 0.2~ps.
Pressure was semi-isotropically coupled to the athmospheric pressure with the Berendsen method~\cite{berendsen84}.

Also simulation without NBFIX~\cite{venable13} was run to check its effect on Na$^+$ binding.

%CaCl_2 simulations by MYKHAILO:
{\it POPC with CaCl$_2$}
The starting structures with varying amounts of CaCl$_2$ ions were constructed using the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder (http://www.charmm-gui.org/) online tool~\cite{lee15}. 
All runs were performed with Gromacs 5.0.3 software package~\cite{abraham15} and CHARMM36 additive force field parameters for lipids~\cite{klauda10} and ions were obtained from CHARMM-GUI input files. 
Standard CHARMM-GUI mdp options were used. Particularly, h-bond lengths were constrained with LINCS~\cite{hess97,hess07}. The temperatures of the 
lipids and the solvent were separately coupled to the Nose-Hoover~\cite{nose84,hoover85} thermostat with a target temperature of 303 K and a relaxation time constant of 1.0 ps. Semi-isotropical 
pressure coupling to 1 bar was obtained with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 5 ps. Equations of motion were integrated with the Verlet algorithm~\cite{pall13} 
using a timestep of 2 fs. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} method with a fourth order smoothing spline. A real space cut-off of 1.2 nm 
was employed with grid spacing of 0.12 nm in the reciprocal space. Lennard-Jones interactions were smoothly switched to zero between 1.0 nm and 1.2 nm. Verlet cutoff-scheme~\cite{pall13}  
were used with the long-range neighbor list updated every 20 steps. Coordinates were written every 10 ps.
After energy minimization and an equilibration run of 0.5 ns, 200ns simulations were ran and the last 100ns of each simulation was employed for the analysis.

\subsubsection{MacRog}
The simulation parameters are identical to those employed in our earlier study~\cite{botan15} for the full 
hydration and dehydration simulations. The initial structures with varying amounts of NaCl were constructed from an 
extensively hydrated bilayer by replacing water molecules with ions using the Gromacs tool genion~\cite{gromacsMANUAL}. Even at the highest 
considered salt concentration, the amount of water molecules per lipid after this replacement process was still greater than 50.

\subsubsection{Orange}
The systems contained 72 POPC lipids and 2880 SPC water molecules, and an appropriate amount of ions as indicated in 
Table~\ref{IONsystems}.  

For the lipids, we used an unpublished force field coined Orange force field. 
Briefly, this includes most bonded interactions from Berger lipids~\cite{berger97}, 
except for dihedrals which were derived via \textit{ab initio} calculations on small model compounds. 
As in Berger lipids, Lennard-Jones parameters are from OPLS.

Partial charges were derived on the basis of \textit{ab initio} calculations. 
In simulations with ions, the qvist parameters were used~\cite{aqvist90}. 
The electrostatics were handled with PME~\cite{darden93,essman95}, with real-space Coulomb cut-off set at 1.8 nm. 
Lennard-Jones potentials were cut off at 1.8 nm. 
The neighborlists for the calculation of non-bonded forces were updated every 5 steps.

Temperature was set to 298K with the velocity-rescale thermostat~\cite{bussi07} using a coupling constant of 0.1 ps$^{-1}$, and the pressure was set to 1 bar using the Berendsen weak coupling algorithm~\cite{berendsen84} (compressibility of 4.5*10$^-5$ bar$^-1$, time constant of 1 ps), coupling separately the x-y dimension and the z dimension to obtain a tensionless system. 
A time step of 2 fs was used for the integration (with the leap-frog algorithm), coordinates were written every 100 ps, 
and the total simulation time was 60 ns. 

All the simulation files for pure lipid simulations are found at ~\cite{zenodo links} and for the simulations with ions at ~\cite{zenodo links}.


\subsubsection{Slipids}
{\it DPPC} The simulation without ions from~\cite{botan15}, available at \cite{slipidsFILES} was used. 
For the simulations with ions, the starting DPPC lipid bilayer, which was built with the online CHARMM-GUI~\cite{lee15}
(http://www.charmm-gui.org/), contained 600 lipids, 30 water molecules/lipid, Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions (150 mM NaCl). 
The TIP3P water model was used to solvate the system and ion parameters by Roux \cite{beglov94,roux96} were used. 
%All-atom MD simulations of DPPC lipid bilayers were performed 
%at ten different temperatures (283, 298, 303, 308, 312, 313, 314, 318, 323, and 333 K) using 
the GROMACS software  package version 4.5.5~\cite{pronk13} and the Stockholm lipids (Slipids) force field parameters 
for phospholipids were used. After energy 
minimization and a short equilibration run of 50 ps (time step 1~fs), 100 ns production runs were performed using 
a time step of 2~fs with leap-frog integrator. All covalent bonds were constrained with the LINCS~\cite{hess97,hess07}
algorithm. Coordinates were written every 100 ps. PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} with real space cut-off at 1.0 nm was used for Coulomb 
interactions. Lennard-Jones interactions were switched to zero between 1.0 nm and 1.4 nm. The neighbour 
lists were updated every 10$^\mathrm{th}$ step with a cut-off of 1.6 nm. Temperature was coupled separately for upper and 
bottom leaflets of the lipid bilayer, and for water to one of the temperatures reported above with the Nos\'e-Hoover 
thermostat~\cite{nose84,hoover85} using a time constant of 0.5 ps. Pressure was semi-isotropically coupled to the atmospheric pressure 
with the Parrinello-Rahman~\cite{parrinello81} barostat using a time constant of 10 ps.
%The last 40 ns of each simulation was employed for the analysis of DPPC choline and glycerol backbone order parameters.
\todo{JM, please add description of the new data}

{\it POPC} The simulation without ions from~\cite{botan15}, available at \cite{slipidsFILESpopc} was used. 
Additionally, a POPC bilayer consisting of 200 lipids, hydrated with 45 water molecules per lipid, 
was simulated in the presence of 130 mM NaCl. 
\todo{Details from the simulation with CaCl}
The Slipids model \cite{jambeck12,jambeck12b}
was employed for lipids, the tip3p model \cite{jorgensen83} for water, and the ion parameters by Smith 
and Dang \cite{smith94} for NaCl. The system was first
equilibrated for 5~ns with a time step of 1~fs after which a 100~ns production run was performed using
a time step of 2~fs. Trajectories were written every 100~ps. The system was kept in a tensionless state at 1~bar 
using a semi-isotropical Parrinello--Rahman barostat \cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 1~ps. 
The temperature was maintained at 310~K
with the velocity rescaling thermostat \cite{bussi07}. The time constant was set to 0.5~ps for both lipids and 
solvent (water and ions) which were coupled separately. Non-bonded interactions were calculated
within a neighbor list with a radius of 1~nm and an update interval of 10 steps. The Lennard-Jones
interactions were cut-off at 1~nm, whereas PME \cite{darden93,essman95} was employed for long-range electrostatics. 
Dispersion correction was applied to both energy and pressure. All bonds were constrained with the LINCS \cite{hess97,hess07}.
algorithm. 

\subsubsection{Lipid14}
The starting structures with varying amounts of ions were constructed using the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder (http://www.charmm-gui.org/) 
online tool~\cite{lee15}. The GROMACS compatible force field parameters generated in~\cite{botan15} and 
available at~\cite{lipid14files} were used. 
The TIP3P water model~\cite{jorgensen83} was used to solvate the system and \r{A}qvist \cite{aqvist90} parameters were used for ions.
All runs were performed with Gromacs 5.0.3 software package~\cite{abraham15}
and LIPID14 force field parameters for POPC~\cite{dickson14}. 

H-bond lengths were constrained with LINCS~\cite{hess97,hess07}. The temperatures of the lipids and the solvent were separately coupled to the 
Nose-Hoover~\cite{nose84,hoover85} thermostat with a target temperature of 298.15 K and a relaxation time constant of 0.1 ps. Semi-isotropical pressure 
coupling to 1 bar was obtained with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 2 ps. Equations of motion were integrated 
with the Verlet algorithm~\cite{pall13} using a timestep of 2 fs. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} method 
with a fourth order smoothing spline. A real space cut-off of 1.0 nm was employed with grid spacing of 0.12 nm in the reciprocal space. 
Lennard-Jones potentials were cut-off at 1 nm, with a dispersion correction applied to both energy and pressure. Verlet cutoff-scheme~\cite{pall13} 
were used with the long-range neighbor list updated every 20 steps. Coordinates were written every 10 ps.

After energy minimization and an equilibration run of 5 ns, 200ns production runs were performed and analysed. In case of the CaCl2 systems 
only the last 100ns of each simulation was employed for the analysis.

\subsubsection{Ulmschneiders}
The starting structures with varying amounts of ions were constructed using the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder (\url{http://www.charmm-gui.org}) 
online tool~\cite{lee15}. The force field parameters were obtained from Lipidbook~\cite{domanski10}. The TIP3P water model~\cite{jorgensen83} 
was used to solvate the system.  Additionally, the simulations of ion-free bilayer were repeated with both Verlet and Group cutoff-schemes~\cite{ulmschneiderPOPC0mMNaClfiles}. 
There was no significant difference in headgroup or glycerol backbone order parameters between these cutoff-schemes. All runs were performed with Gromacs 5.0.3 software package~\cite{abraham15}. 
The glycerol backbone order parameters without iones were not the same as reported in the previous study~\cite{botan15}.
The origin of discrepancy was located to the different initial structures which was taken from CHARMM-GUI in this work
and from Lipidbook in the previous work. Since the order parameters with the initial structure from CHARMM-GUI are
closer to the experimental values, the results indicate that the structure available from Lipidbook is stuck to a
state with incorrect glycerol backbone strucuture, for more discussion see \url{https://github.com/NMRLipids/lipid_ionINTERACTION/issues/8}.

All-bond lengths were constrained with LINCS~\cite{hess97,hess07}. The temperatures of the lipids and the solvent were separately coupled to the Nose-Hoover~\cite{nose84,hoover85} 
thermostat with a target temperature of 298.15 K and a relaxation time constant of 0.1 ps. Semi-isotropical pressure coupling to 1 bar was obtained 
with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat~\cite{parrinello81} with a time constant of 2 ps. Equations of motion were integrated with the Verlet algorithm~\cite{pall13} using a 
timestep of 2 fs. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME~\cite{darden93,essman95} method with a fourth order smoothing spline. 
A real space cut-off of 1.0 nm was employed with grid spacing of 0.12 nm in the reciprocal space. Lennard-Jones potentials were cut-off at 1 nm, 
with a dispersion correction applied to both energy and pressure. Verlet cutoff-scheme~\cite{pall13} were used with the long-range neighbor list updated 
every 20 steps. Coordinates were written every 10 ps. After energy minimization and an equilibration run of 5 ns, 200ns simulations were ran and 
the last 100ns of each simulation was employed for the analysis.
